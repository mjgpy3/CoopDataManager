Checking for duplicates in parent records and student records would be helpful.
When viewing either the parent table of records or the student table, could the tables be in alphabetical order?
I was not yet able to test adding students into any classes.
The label 'age min & max' should more accurately be 'grade min & max'.
Each class record should be able to link to 1-2 teachers as well as 0-6 helpers.
Can the semester be chosen only once at the beginning of data entry?
DONE: The cost per class will always be an integer.
DONE: The grade min & max should accept only the following data options...Nurs, Pre-K, K, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,and 12
