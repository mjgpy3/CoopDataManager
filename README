Objective:

     This project has multiple facets. In the micro view it is
intended to be a structure for easily managing, querying and
generating reports for a homeschool-co-op-like setting. For
more information on the micro, see the ER diagram in the Design
folder... In the macro sense, it is meant to be an intellegent,
MVC-based system in which data can be easily handled (in much
of the same mannors as listed above). It should, if I continue
to follow the same pattern that I have been following, have
an appropriate blend of configuration and convention. Just the
way it should be.

Design:

     At this point, the architecture is MVC, this should not
change. If you don't know what MVC is, there's this awesome
service out there online known as Google. Anyways, my intent
is for the architecture to highly resemble that of Ruby on
Rails (an elegent MVC implementation to be sure).

     The Model (M in MVC) is an abstraction of Sqlite3. I use
Sqlite3 for a few reasons, primarly being that it is free, open,
easy to use and Python has builtin Sqlite3 functionality. Python,
by the way, is a huge component in the model as it is in this
entire project.

     The Controller (C) is currently entirely written in Python, for
many of the same reasons as listed in the Model rationale.

     The View (V) is written in Python, specifically using the PyGtk
module. I am using GLADE to ease the process of making the actual GUI
and windows.

     This project's code is totally free for anyone to use. However,
ye be warned, if any damage occurs because of this software, by the
